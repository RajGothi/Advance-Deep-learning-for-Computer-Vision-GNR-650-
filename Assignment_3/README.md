Working on Assignment-3

Jigsaw done..
Patch prediction to be done -- Downstream task is remaining.
paper-review-2 to be done..


## Self-Supervised Techniques:

1. [Jigsaw_pretext_CIFAR10.ipynb](Jigsaw_pretext_CIFAR10.ipynb)
   - Learn image feature representation through solving Jigsaw puzzle of jumbled patches of images.
   
2. [Patch_Prediction_CIFAR10.ipynb](Patch_Prediction_CIFAR10.ipynb)
   - Learn image feature representation via finding the relative patch location of patches of images.
     
## Model Performance

| Model                    | Validation Accuracy | Test Accuracy |
|--------------------------|----------------------|---------------|
| Jigsaw SSL |  96.48%               |         |
| Jigsaw SSL - Downstream Task                   |         |
| Relative patch location SSL                       |         |
| Relative patch location SSL - Downsteam Task                          |        |
