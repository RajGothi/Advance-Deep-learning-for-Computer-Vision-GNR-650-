Working on Assignment-3

Jigsaw done..
Patch prediction to be done -- Downstream task is remaining.

## Self-Supervised Techniques:

1. [Jigsaw_pretext_CIFAR10.ipynb](Jigsaw_pretext_CIFAR10.ipynb)
   - Learn image feature representation through solving Jigsaw puzzle of jumbled patches of images.
   
2. [Patch_Prediction_CIFAR10.ipynb](Patch_Prediction_CIFAR10.ipynb)
   - Learn image feature representation via finding the relative patch location of patches of images.
